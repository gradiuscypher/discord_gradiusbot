- Include a screenshot *only*, do not upload a photo of your screen.
- Please ensure that the character screen is horizontal and not vertical.
- Do not edit the screenshot in any way or you may prevent the bot from capturing your character's names.
- Only include a screenshot of the game itself, if you're capturing an emulator screen, do not capture the emulator window.
- Only include one screenshot each time you run the command. If you have alt accounts, run this command again.
- An example of an ideal screenshot can be found here: TODO:INCLUDE_LINK_HERE
- If you run into any issues, use the bug-report command or message anyone in the IT role on Discord.
